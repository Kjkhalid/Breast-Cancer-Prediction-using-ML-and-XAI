# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-ML-and-XAI
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women globally, 
representing a significant public health concern. Early diagnosis can improve 
prognosis and chances of survival by enabling timely clinical treatment. Accurate 
classification of benign tumors is crucial to prevent unnecessary treatments. 
Consequently, correct diagnosis and classification of breast cancer as malignant or 
benign are subjects of extensive research. Machine learning is widely recognized as 
the methodology of choice for breast cancer pattern classification and forecast 
modeling due to its unique advantages in detecting critical features from complex 
datasets.
Classification and data mining methods are effective in classifying data, 
particularly in the medical field, where they are widely used for diagnosis and analysis 
to support decision-making. This study compares seven algorithms (SVM, Logistic 
Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, XgBoost, and Na√Øve Bayes) 
for predicting breast cancer outcomes using various datasets. All experiments were 
conducted in a simulation environment on the JUPYTER platform. The proposed 
work can be used to predict the performance of various methods, allowing the 
selection of the most suitable approach based on the requirements.
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have been incorporated to 
enhance transparency and interpretability. XAI methods provide insights into the 
decision-making process, revealing the factors and features contributing to the 
predictions. A user-friendly website has been developed to facilitate model 
deployment and accessibility, allowing users to input data and obtain predictions, 
along with explanations for the model's reasoning. The XAI implementation and 
website development aim to promote understanding and trust in the model's 
predictions, ultimately supporting informed decision-making in breast cancer 
diagnosis and treatment.
